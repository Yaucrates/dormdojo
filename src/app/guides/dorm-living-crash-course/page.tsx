                <p>
                    This is a guide on how to succeed at living away from home.
                    This is coming from someone who&#39;s just finished their
                    freshman year at college, and participated in many summer
                    programs away from home. As we get closer to the fall and
                    everyone starts thinking &quot;holy hell, I&#39;m actually
                    gonna be in college soon&quot;, here&#39;s my advice on dorm
                    essentials, roommates, bathrooms, life skills, and
                    homesickness.
                </p>

                    <strong>Dorm essentials:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>A mattress pad.</strong> I have never slept
                            on a bed in an institution that was actually
                            comfortable. Invest in a good one. It will save your
                            back and also make coming home to sleep a lot nicer.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Shower shoes and a shower caddy.</strong> Do
                            I even need to explain this one?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Room decor.</strong> It’s a lot less
                            depressing to be in a shoebox of a room if you have
                            decor. There isn’t a ton of space for things like
                            throw pillows or beanbags, but having printed
                            pictures and fairy lights can make your room a lot
                            more cozy. A little rug is nice too.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Wireless headphones/earbuds.</strong> Your
                            roommate does not want to listen to your TV show or
                            music as you putter about your room. Wireless
                            headphones allow you to listen to whatever you want
                            without disturbing your roommate. As a general rule
                            of thumb, unless you are watching/listening to
                            something socially or are alone, you should be using
                            headphones.

                                Extension cords with power strips are a must.

                            I shit you not, I had a single outlet in my dorm
                            room that I had to figure out how to run a fridge
                            off of while also charging all my devices and
                            running a diffuser, a fan, and a tea kettle.

                            <strong>Living essentials.</strong> I’m talking
                            about cleaning supplies, bedding, dishes, towels,
                            first aid supplies, a water bottle, laundry stuff,
                            etc. Your dorm room largely functions as a miniature
                            house and as such, you will need the supplies to
                            cook, clean, and generally take care of yourself.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Appliances</strong> are tricky. I would look
                            at dorm rules and what you can afford before
                            investing. Also, coordinate with your roommate about
                            who will buy what. As it stands, the essential dorm
                            appliances are a fridge, microwave, and hot water
                            pot. You can make all the essentials (tea and ramen)
                            with those supplies. A Brita filter is nice if you
                            can fit it in your fridge. If your dorm doesn’t have
                            AC, get a standing fan. It will keep you alive
                            during the hot and humid months.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Lock.</strong> You’ll want a locked drawer
                            for ~reasons~, whether that be money, medication,
                            important documents, whatever. There is some stuff
                            you just can’t risk getting stolen.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Storage bins</strong> will save you. Store
                            food, school books, etc in them. Make sure they fit
                            in the places you want them to before buying!
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Other stuff:</strong> clothes, shoes,
                            jackets, toiletries, school supplies, bags, sports
                            equipment. Basically anything you use on a day to
                            day basis.

                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Side note: less is more.</strong> I made the mistake
                    of bringing way too much stuff. It’s a pain in the ass to
                    haul around during move-in and move-out and is generally
                    just not worth it. People often overestimate the number of
                    clothes and number of nostalgic items they need. I promise
                    you, it’s so much nicer to just have the essentials of
                    living with a few comfort/nostalgic/fancy things. You don’t
                    need to bring your entire shoe or book collection.

                            <strong>Laundry.</strong> Please know how to do
                            laundry. Do not leave your items in a washer/dryer
                            overnight or longer than the wash cycle. Someone
                            might throw it on the ground, or worse, throw it
                            out.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Dishes.</strong> Moldy food is not only
                            gross, but it will make your room smell like shit
                            and your roommate want to defenestrate you. Nobody
                            cleans up for you in a dorm.

                            <strong>General tidiness.</strong> Most dorms are
                            shoeboxes. What flies as “clean” in a larger room
                            does not fly as “clean” in a dorm room because the
                            space is so small. Have a place for everything and
                            keep spaces like your desk surface clear. Hang up
                            and fold your clothes. Take out the damn trash and
                            make your bed! I promise you, making your bed each
                            day makes a world of difference not only in your
                            physical environment but also your mental headspace.

                            <strong>Basic cooking.</strong> You don’t need to be
                            able to whip up a Michelin star meal, but learn how
                            to make simple meals in case you can’t get food from
                            the college dining halls or order online. As a rule
                            of thumb, it’s always good to have a couple packets
                            of instant ramen and instant oatmeal lying around.

                            <strong>Know who to call.</strong> If something goes
                            wrong, you’re going to want to have the contact
                            information of relevant people like your RA or
                            security services. I recommend inputting those
                            contacts once you have them into your phone.

                            <strong>Medical issues.</strong> If you have a
                            chronic illness, disability, or any type of
                            condition mental or physical that needs to be
                            managed by a doctor, you&#39;re going to need to get
                            a practitioner set up near your college. Have your
                            current doctor help find you one or use the
                            college&#39;s resources (many keep a list of
                            providers). Figure out your health insurance, the
                            hospital you&#39;ll primarily seek care from, and
                            pharmacies. Keep all the paperwork and documentation
                            you&#39;ll need accessible. Get your school
                            accommodations set up preemptively!

                        <p>
                            <strong>Money management.</strong> The basic
                            principles of financial health such as having a bank
                            account, keeping a relative budget, and not living
                            outside your means are crucial. Personally, I would
                            recommend getting a credit/debit card set up before
                            you leave home. Cash is not king, and it sometimes
                            can be hard to find ATMs on campus. Having an
                            emergency credit card attached to my parent&#39;s
                            bank account is something that I have had all four
                            years and is a contingency for me for medical or
                            transportation emergencies. Have your own bank
                            account and understand how to access it and not go
                            into debt.

                            <strong>Critical items.</strong> Having important
                            documentation is really important. If you don&#39;t
                            have a drivers license, you&#39;ll need a state ID
                            or a passport. Memorize your SSN! It&#39;s likely
                            you&#39;ll need it at some point. You should have
                            your health insurance cards to use in case you need
                            to seek emergency medical treatment. If you have
                            chronic illnesses or disabilities, know where and
                            how to access your diagnostic paperwork, along with
                            things like vaccine records and medication lists. If
                            you have a car, you&#39;ll need your car&#39;s
                            registration and insurance. Once you have your
                            student ID and key to your dorm, don&#39;t lose it.
                            Keep all of this type of stuff either with you,
                            digitally, or in a locked drawer in your dorm.

                            <strong>Time management.</strong> Nobody will police
                            you when you’re away from home. You need to figure
                            out how to make a schedule and stick to it. Routine
                            can be very beneficial during times of stress.

                            <strong>Coping skills.</strong> Living away from
                            home can be stressful in itself. There are lots of
                            supports built in to an undergrad college, but
                            knowing how to take care of yourself and your
                            emotions is key. I have a list here.

                            <strong>Self-care.</strong> A lot of people have the
                            misconception that self-care is a fancy bubble bath
                            or an expensive meal. Self-care is really about
                            practicality and helping yourself succeed. Think of
                            it as investing in your future self, whether that be
                            legitimate self-improvement or just lessening the
                            burdens your future self will have to carry. Whether
                            that be going to the gym on a regular basis, setting
                            boundaries with toxic friends, keeping a strict
                            morning routine, or doing work when you don’t want
                            to because you know it will bite you in the ass,
                            self-care is key to keeping yourself not only
                            functional, but happy. Of course there’s always room
                            to treat yourself, but that should not be the focus.
                            It’s hard to build up self-discipline which is key
                            to self-care, but it’s really worth it.

                            <strong>Seeking help.</strong> Living away from home
                            is hard. Feeling like an adult for the first time is
                            hard. Use the resources you are provided with to
                            your best advantage. Student health services,
                            counseling, disability accommodations, writing
                            centers, career centers, etc. All these resources at
                            your disposal can help you succeed. There’s no shame
                            in asking for help. College is a time of transition
                            between the teen years and the &quot;real&quot;
                            adult years. The rug won&#39;t be pulled out from
                            under you completely. There are still a lot of
                            safeguards and people who can help.

                            the first time they are away from home is the first
                            time they face accountability. There is no parent to
                            step in or soften the blow. Your actions, either
                            positive or negative, have consequences. It’s okay
                            to have fun, but don’t compromise your integrity or
                            future.

                    I can’t believe I am dedicating a whole section to this, but
                    I know communal bathrooms are a large source of fear for
                    y’all. Side note, I only have the experience of living in a
                    single-gender dorm, so I don’t know how coed bathrooms would
                    work.

                            (even behind a curtain), change in your room
                            instead. Wear a robe to the bathroom along with
                            shower shoes. Bring a shower caddy with all your
                            toiletries and a towel. Then walk to the bathroom,
                            pop in the shower, put on your robe again, and go
                            back into your room to change into real clothes.

                            make the bathroom gross. It&#39;s disgusting and

                    For many people, this will be the first time living with
                    someone and sharing the same space. Dorm rooms are small,
                    and you will become intimately acquainted with your roommate
                    in many ways. Having a roommate can be an absolutely
                    wonderful experience and how you make a best friend or it
                    can be very challenging.

                            <strong>Setting boundaries.</strong> The biggest
                            source of bad roommate experiences is bad boundaries
                            or total lack of them. When you first get a roommate
                            and establish a rapport, make it clear what is
                            acceptable to you and what isn’t. Then come up with
                            a list that you both agree with or can make
                            compromises on. Most colleges pair roommates up by
                            living style questionnaires, but it can’t help to
                            make clarifications. Some examples of questions to
                            ask:

                            dorm is their “safe space” and so it’s worth it to

                            as possible. Talk to your RA to resolve imminent

                            experience is unique and valuable. When you go home,

                            or life. Although wanting to go home may feel safer,
                            you’ll grow a lot if you stick it out.

                            Maintaining relationships with your family and close
                            friends from home is essential. Maintaining
                            long-distance relationships with friendships can be
                            difficult, so I recommend regularly making time to
                            FaceTime or text, or even meet up if your paths
                            somehow intersect. Your parents will probably want
                            to hear from you, so make sure you call them every
                            so often, provided you want to and have a good
                            relationship. They’ve likely been one of the biggest
                            sources of comfort and support for you for your
                            whole life, and now that you’ve moved out, that
                            won’t go away. You&#39;re not going to lose your
                            home life entirely.

                            Build connections at school. Although it’s scary,
                            the first few months of college are when people
                            really start to build friendships and friendship
                            groups. Joining clubs, participating in orientation
                            stuff, getting involved with sport teams, talking to
                            people in classes, and generally making an effort to
                            be social will help you build your own community.

                            If your homesickness is becoming overwhelming, or
                            severely detrimental to your mental health, seek
                            support through the student mental health office or
                            the equivalent. It will eventually pass, or at least
                            become more bearable, and seeking support can help
                            make the burden easier.

                    I think that is about everything! If you have specific
                    questions, reply below and I&#39;ll do my best to answer.
                    Moving away from home was simultaneously the scariest thing
                    I’ve ever done but also the best. I learned so much about
                    independence, responsibility, self-reliance, and
                    self-advocacy. Really, I just learned how to make my way
                    through life.
